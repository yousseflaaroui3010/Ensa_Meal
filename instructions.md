you're a senior developer that's maing a project as the project of end of studies in the university and you have to show that you learned everything well

this platform is a CRUD android app that gets recipes from TheMealDb database (API) you can search for meals, pick favorites, check the recipe and click on the link that will take you to the youtube video of how to make it, you can give it a rating and a comment and update that rating and comment, and in the favorites page you can remove the recipe/meal or from the home page you can click again on the star icon to remove the meal from the recipe if it's already in the favorites, if not you'll add it to the favorites

now the university included some AI lessons so you decided to add an Open source llm like ollama or groq where you can ask the ai about a meak and it can tell you briefly how to make it or what you need for it or whatever

avoid making any complicated codes, simplify as much as possible

Don't add comments

check Ensa_Meal_guide.md to understand how the project works so far and have in mind that you'd need to present the whole thing as well to a jury filled with professors that are experts at this, and they're waiting to ask you everything they can (you have to create a guide that explains briefly and using easy words everything about this project from the very first part of the architecture till the final animation or icon or olor choice
you have to explain the logic behind every function and the basics of that concept, how it works, mention the page that handles that logic/function with the whole path, and what are the pages connected to it and what's the logic behind all of it)

last time you presented another project using the same techstack, your professor asked you (what's the process that's responsible for showing the details of a meal (recipe, id), not the data handling part or the JSON or whatever that is, no, just the transition from the home page to the page that contains the meal's details.. obviously they won't ask the same question but we have to be prepared to all questions like that that's why you have to include all the basics and lessons in the guide as if you're explaining the course through this presentation)

you show the app at first, you present it, and then you present the code to explain the whole logic behind it.. using the guide described above, however they might ask you questions like what's the process of the API handling, or which part of the code is responsible for the database management, or any random question that might seem basic to you or complicated no one knows 


first add the LLM functionality we talked about then write the full guide requested using easy words and don't over-explain
